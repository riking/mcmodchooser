===============================
*Step 1: Unpack the folder
===============================
Place the "jarmodloader" folder from this archive in your .minecraft.
=====================================
*Step 2: Take care of pre-modded jars
=====================================
If your minecraft.jar has mods in it:
    Open the jarmodloader folder.
    Copy the "Template" folder. (Hold Ctrl, hit C. This will be abbreviated Ctrl-C.)
    Paste. (Ctrl-V)
    Hit F2 to rename the new folder. ("Copy of Template")
    Name it "Mod3".
    Open the Mod3 folder.
    Open mod.txt with Notepad.
    Make the second line "My mods               " or whatever else you want to call it.
      WARNING: MUST BE EXACTLY 22 CHARACTERS. COUNT THEM.
      (And by "must", I mean that the menu will look screwy if it isn't.)
    Make the fourth line the current Minecraft version.
    Save mod.txt. (Ctrl-S)
    Go to your bin folder.
    Copy your minecraft.jar. (Click, Ctrl-C)
    Go back to the Mod3 folder.
    Paste. (Ctrl-V)
    If you have other modded minecraft.jar files:
        Repeat the above, except:
            Numerically increase the folder number each time. (E.g. "Mod4", "Mod5", "Mod6".)
            In mod.txt, don't name them the same. (Unless you want to.)
            And finally, make sure to rename the file to "minecraft.jar" or it won't work.
    If you don't have a copy of a unmodded minecraft.jar:
        Delete your bin folder.
        Start the launcher and redownload minecraft.jar.
===============================
*Step 3: Set up vanilla (backup)
===============================
Go to your bin folder.
Copy your unmodded minecraft.jar. (Click, Ctrl-C)
Open the Mod1 folder.
Paste. (Ctrl-V)
Open mod.txt with Notepad.
Make the fourth line the current Minecraft version.
Save mod.txt. (Ctrl-S)
===============================
*Step 4: Configure options file
===============================
Go back to the jarmodloader folder.
Open options.txt with notepad.
Minimize notepad.
Find your Minecraft.exe (the launcher).
Right click it and select Properties.
Drag your mouse over the "Location" field.
Copy. (Ctrl-C)
Open Notepad back up.
Click in the line right below the part that says "Location of Minecraft.exe".
Paste. (Ctrl-V) Do nothing else with this line.
If you want Mc Mod Chooser to automatically start with Username Spoofing selected, type in your desired username.
